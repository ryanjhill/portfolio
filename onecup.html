			<h2>Introduction.</h2>
			<p>
				For the purpose of my mechancial engineering product design class, I worked for 10 weeks with a team of 5 students to design a physical project that could solve real user needs in a simple way. This was an interesting class for me in a few ways. For one, I have a decent amount of experience with design and programming, but I had never really dappled with physical products in any way. I now had to think about a very different set of concerns, such as prototype and manufacturing costs, production timelines, and consumer health concerns.
			</p>

			<h2>Early Needfinding and Ideation.</h2>
			<p>
				Trying to find similiarities amongst our group members, we quickly turned our attention towards something that all of our group could relate to: caring around a reusable water bottle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Interestingly, the reasons that we had for carrying around our bottles were incredibly varying. Some of us even carried around more than one bottle to handle different events, such as one bottle to hold water and one to hold protein gainer for when he worked out.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only was there no one-solution-fits-all for those of us with multiple carry-around bottles, but there wasn't any real consensus amongst our group on what made a great standard water bottle. Each of us wanted slightly different things, and each of us had some gripes about our current bottle.
			</p>
			<p>
				We set out to ask other busy college students if they had the same problems. We sampled 32 students from one campus apartments, 25 NCAA athletes, 10 gym goers, and 12 students who took the bus to campus. Amazingly, we saw a lot of the same trends from our group: no one really liked their reusable bottle, and everyone had very specific things they wanted to use their bottle for.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another thing that nearly every person noted about there bottles was that they absolutely hated cleaning them. Getting the bottoms and the lids washed (and smelling clean) was a huge hassle for everyone. Many people eventually gave up on their bottles and would start using them again once they felt "kinda clean" or "clean enough." Some users we interviewed even bought new reusable bottles every few months because their old one felt too impossible to clean (doesn't that defeat the reusable part?)
			</p>
			<p>
				This idea of a busy college student with multiple needs but is constantly on the go quickly became a guiding persona. It was clean this busibody needed a modern reusable water bottle that was easy to use and even easier to clean. It potentially had to fit small particular needs that varied widely amongst potential users, while making sure not to alienate other users.
			</p>
			<p>
				We asked our interviewees how much they paid for their past solutions, or would expect to pay for the ones that they saw their peers using. Most students were comfortable paying about $30 for what they considered a solid water bottle, and those who were looking to replace their dysfunctionla current bottle tended to be willing to pay more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem space seemed very real, so we decided to move into market research to see if this was a viable space to enter.
			</p>
			<h2>Market Research.</h2>
			<p>

			</p>
			<div class="blockquote">
				<p>
					"The groundswell of demand has helped producers of stainless bottles experience a huge surge in sales, seemingly overnight."<br>- TIME Magazine
				</p>
				<p>
					"Municipal water systems are aging. Environmentalists are castigating the makers of bottled water - and the people who buy it - for defiling the environment with plastic. All told, it is a great time to be selling water filters and reusable bottles."<br>- NY Times
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				The market for reusable beverage bottle is huge. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Newell Rubbermaid reports a market size of approximately $1.5 billion in the US alone. They match those high numbers with an interesting observation - this sizeable industry is incredibly fragmented, with users having little to no brand loyalty. This seemed to reflect our empirical findings, suggesting that this market had ideally low barriers of entry.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Sam Altman of YCombinator loves to note, it's not just the size of the market, it's the future size of the market that's important. Again, we found a great fit; Nielsen Holding estimated that $12 billion was spent yearly on disposable water bottles in the US, and that these numbers were decreasing rapidly. This change is largely because of two factors: newer millenials have a strong desire to impact the environment, and many regions are implimenting regulations and/or fines to cut down on overuse of plastics.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was initially surprised the reusable bottles were a $1.5 billion industry - I was even more surprised to find out that a $12 billion industry was quickly enroute to feeding into the industry's expected upcoming hyper-growth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although more research into the cost structure for this type of product line would have probably been a good idea, from briefly looking over competitor financial reports, it seemed like something our team felt comfortable putting off until after we had decided exactly what components our product should entail to properly tackle the user problem.
